$! This procedure builds the following:
$!
$! [.pcap-vci]
$!   A port of pcap using the VCI interface to the LAN driver. This
$!   version of pcap uses the PCAPVCM execlet and is faster than the
$!   QIO implementation of pcap. This version allows you to send packets
$!   as well as receiving packets.
$!
$! [.pcapvcm]
$!   The VMS execlet which uses the VCI interface to the LAN driver.
$!   Once built it must be placed in SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES.
